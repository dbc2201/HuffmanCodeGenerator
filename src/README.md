# Huffman Code Generator

Programmers use Huffman codes for encoding files to save up space.

A PDF to the Huffman tree is available in this repository [here](res/huffman.pdf).

A guide to Huffman trees in given in the Book by Elliot B. Koffman.

Here is your problem statement.

> The user will input a string in your program.
>1. convert the string to a lowercase string
>2. map all the characters of the lowercase string to their 8-bit binary representation.
>3. show the full 8-bit binary encoded string of the user's input string.
>4. map all the characters of the lowercase string to the huffman tree codes for the characters and space.
>5. show the full variable length encoded string of the user's input string.
